# 🏇 Derby Betting Model — Data Science with Horse Racing

This project builds a transparent, educational model for analysing and predicting outcomes in high-level UK flat horse races — starting with races like the **Epsom Derby**.

It’s designed to teach, document, and showcase skills in:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning & feature engineering
- Betting market behaviour
- Predictive modelling
- Real-world sports data strategy

## 📚 Lessons So Far

### `lesson-01-eda-derby-race-structure.ipynb`
We explore real 2019 UK race data to understand what Derby-type races *look like*:

- Race distance and going conditions
- Field size and structure
- What we include, what we filter, and why

This gives us the **environment** in which both horses and betting markets operate.

### `lesson-02-market-odds-and-favourites.ipynb` *(coming soon)*
We’ll investigate:

- How often favourites win
- What odds distributions look like
- Whether market prices reflect reality

This is the first step toward identifying **value bets** and understanding **market efficiency**.

## 📂 Data Sources

We’re using public 2019 UK horse racing data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hwaitt/horse-racing), merged and filtered within each notebook.

Live data sources (scraping or API access) will be explored in a later notebook.
