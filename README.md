# 🏇 Derby Betting Model 2025

This is a hands-on machine learning and data science project that builds a horse racing betting model for the **2025 Betfred Derby**, using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

It starts from scratch and evolves week by week — documenting everything in readable, well-commented notebooks.
