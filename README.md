# 🐎 Predicting Horse Races with Data

This is a data science project focused on **UK horse racing**, using real-world data to estimate race outcomes — just like a bookmaker or bettor would.

We’re using this project to:
- Learn end-to-end sports modeling (from raw data to decision-making)
- Build reusable tools for racing, betting, and beyond
- Document the journey clearly for ourselves and future employers

---

## 🎯 Goal

> Can we estimate a horse’s **chance of winning**, using only the data available *before* a race?

We’re not just modelling — we’re exploring:
- How racing works (distances, classes, going, form, odds)
- What features matter — and which don’t
- How odds reflect market beliefs
- Whether we can spot **value bets** the market has missed

This isn’t a betting tipster project — it’s a **data science learning lab**.

## 📍 Current Focus: The Epsom Derby (Flat Racing)

We’re starting with elite UK flat races for **3-year-olds**, like the **Epsom Derby**.

Our early questions:
- What do “Derby-type” races look like?
- How do favourites perform?
- What signals might help us predict future winners?

## 🧰 Tools & Tech

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter notebooks
- Public Kaggle datasets (2019 UK racing)
- Git & GitHub for reproducibility and sharing
