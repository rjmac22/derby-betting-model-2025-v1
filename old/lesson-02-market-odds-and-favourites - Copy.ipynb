    "# 🧠 Lesson 2: Do Favourites Really Win?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores one of the most common beliefs in horse racing:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 📣 **What people say about favourites in racing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Favourites win more often, but the odds are too short to be profitable.”  \n",
    "> — [FlatStats.co.uk](https://www.flatstats.co.uk/horseracing/index.php?cmd=article&id=102)\n",
    "\n",
    "> “While the favourite has a higher chance of winning, it doesn't mean you will make a profit betting on them.”  \n",
    "> — [GrandNational.Fans](https://www.grandnational.fans/news/how-often-do-favourites-win/)\n",
    "\n",
    "> “The favourite-longshot bias... is the empirical finding that bettors tend to overvalue longshots and undervalue favourites.”  \n",

    "- 💰 **Odds vs Outcome** – does a lower price actually mean higher win probability?\n",
    "- 🔍 **Upsets** – how often does a horse with long odds win?\n",
    "- 📉 **Any patterns?** – e.g. field size, going, class, number of runners?\n",

    "This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of all implied probabilities in a race will usually exceed 100%.\n",

    "This excess is the bookmaker’s profit margin — often between 110% and 130% in UK horse racing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In racing lingo, this is referred to as “the book” (e.g. “the book was 118%”).\n",
    "\n",
    "So when we analyse favourite odds, we're seeing prices with the overround already built in.\n",
