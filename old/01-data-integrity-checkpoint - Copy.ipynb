    "# 🧹 Data Integrity Checkpoint (2019 Horse Racing Data)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first notebook in our horse racing modelling project.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re using historical UK race data to learn how to build our own predictive models — the same way bookmakers, syndicates, and serious bettors do.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we do any analysis or modelling, we need to ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🧠 Can we trust this data?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📦 What’s This Dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was published on Kaggle and contains UK and Irish horse racing data from **1990 to 2020**, across two files per year:\n",
    "- `races_YEAR.csv` — one row per race\n",
    "- `horses_YEAR.csv` — one row per horse in a race\n",
    "\n",
    "Each horse entry includes odds, trainer, age, and finishing position.  \n",
    "Each race entry includes track, distance, conditions, and prize money.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📍 Why Are We Using It?\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🆓 It’s free and publicly available  \n",
    "- 🧠 It’s ideal for learning and prototyping  \n",
    "- 📊 It includes real-world race outcomes and betting prices  \n",
    "- 🏇 It’s detailed enough to build serious models — but simple enough for newcomers\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve chosen to start with **just 2019** because:\n",
    "- It’s the last full \"normal\" season before COVID-19 disrupted the sport\n",
    "- It’s large enough to explore a wide range of race types\n",
    "- We can expand later if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧭 Why This Still Matters (Even If It’s Old)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this dataset stops in 2020, it’s perfect for learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can explore patterns in elite races (like the Epsom Derby)\n",
    "- We can practice building models using real bookmaker odds and outcomes\n",
    "- We can learn which features matter — and which don’t\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we understand how to clean, analyse, and model this historical data, we’ll be better equipped to:\n",
    "- Scrape or buy live racecards for upcoming races\n",
    "- Apply our models to races happening today or in the future\n",
    "- Extend this project into other sports or betting formats\n",
    "\n",
    "This is our **training ground** — not the final product.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 What This Notebook Will Do\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is not about modelling. It’s about **understanding**:\n",
    "- What the raw data really contains\n",
    "- What might be broken, missing, or misleading\n",
    "- What needs to be fixed or excluded\n",
    "\n",
    "This is about **building trust** in our data before using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll also begin answering:\n",
    "- What other data would we need to model specific races like the Epsom Derby?\n",
    "- What’s missing from this dataset (e.g. sectional times, pace, Betfair odds)?\n",
    "- When will scraping or paid data be required?\n",
    "\n",
    "This sets the foundation for every notebook that comes next.\n"
